// Package mdoc is Muse's Markdown document model and its native renderer.

// editor or the AI layer can read and rewrite; View draws that tree with
// the mygo ui package, so a document shows in a native window with no
// webview and no frontend build.

// The model is deliberately shallow: every block is a value, and the tree
// is small enough to serialize, diff and hand to a model as context.
