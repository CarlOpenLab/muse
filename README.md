# Muse

**What you write is what you see.** A fully native Markdown editor with a tool-using AI writing agent — the whole app is drawn by Go on the GPU: no WebView, no Electron.

Built with [MyGo](https://mygo.egoist.dev/). The window, icon rail, file tree, outline, search, the AI agent panel and the editor itself are all drawn by Go with MyGo's `ui` package (Metal / Direct3D 11 / OpenGL), with text laid out by the system's own engine (Core Text / DirectWrite / Pango). One Go binary — no browser engine and no Node at runtime.

## The editor

The editor (`native/mdedit`) is one surface the whole document is written on, behaving as Typora does:

- **Seamless WYSIWYG** — the document *is* the rendering: the caret moves continuously through paragraphs, headings, lists, quotes, tables, code and math, and selections cross blocks to copy, cut and delete.
- **Syntax only at the caret** — block syntax (`#`, list markers, `>`, fences, table pipes) never shows; the markers of `**bold**`, `` `code` ``, `[links](url)`, `$math$` and `![images](src)` appear in light gray only while the caret is in them, and render again when it leaves.
- **Markdown as you type** — `# `, `- `, `1. `, `- [ ] `, `> ` at the start of a line become a heading, list, task or quote at once; ```` ``` ```` opens a closed code block, `$$` a math block, and `| a | b |` + Enter a table.
- **Typora's keys** — Enter continues a list (and leaves it on an empty item) or a quote; `Shift+Enter` breaks the line; Backspace at the start of a block turns a heading into a paragraph and an item out of its list; `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` nest list items and walk table cells; `⌘B/I/U/E/K`, `⌘0–6`, `⌘⇧Q/[/]/K/M` and `⌘⌥T` format; full undo and redo — the agent's edits included.
- **Native rendering** — headings, task lists, code highlighted in 30+ languages, tables (alignment, row/column commands), images (local, remote, pasted or dropped — saved into `assets/`), block and inline math typeset with go-latex on the text's baseline, footnotes, YAML front matter and inline HTML formatting tags.
- **Mermaid, natively** — flowcharts, sequence, state, pie, class and Gantt subsets, drawn whenever the caret is elsewhere.
- **Input methods** — Chinese and Japanese input methods compose at the caret, with their candidate window beside it.
- **Workspace panel** — file tree, an outline that follows the caret, find and replace, and the AI assistant share one sidebar, switched from the icon rail; text files that are not Markdown (`.json`, `.go`, …) open as highlighted code.

## The agent

The AI panel is a real writing agent, not a chat box:

- **13 document tools** — list, read, search, outline, workspace tree, stats, open, edit (exact-match replace), insert, write, rename, trash-delete, create folder.
- **Tool approval cards** — before any write, the agent shows what it is about to change. Approve once, always for this session, or deny; denials flow back into the conversation.
- **Permission presets** — *Ask every time* / *Full access* / *Read-only*, one click next to the composer.
- **Capability groups** — browse, edit and file-management tools can be switched on/off per group in settings; disabled tools are never sent to the model.
- **Transparent turns** — collapsible thinking, per-tool status rows with arguments and results, streamed Markdown answers; your words sit right, the agent's steps sit left.
- **OpenAI-compatible** — any endpoint (OpenAI, DeepSeek, local gateways); endpoints without function calling degrade gracefully to plain chat.

Privacy: agent tools are sandboxed to the workspace root; API keys and chat history stay in local config files (mode 0600).

## Install

Grab a build from [Releases](https://github.com/CarlOpenLab/muse/releases/latest) (Windows / macOS / Linux), or from source:

```bash
go run -C native .            # run
go build -C native -o Muse .  # build a binary
go test -C native ./...       # tests
```

Requires Go 1.27.3+. No Node, no pnpm, no vite — there is no frontend build at all.

## Project layout

```

## Known limits

- Math is typeset with go-latex; rarer TeX commands may fall back to source.
- Mermaid covers flowcharts, sequence, state, pie, a class-diagram subset and a Gantt subset; advanced features may render as code.
- Chat history is capped at the last 100 messages.
